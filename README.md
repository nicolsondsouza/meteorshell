Meteor Shell 0.0.1

![Meteor Shell](http://grigio.org/files/meteor-shell.png)

This is a basic terminal, it will run Linux/Unix commands on the server
and will print on the screen the output.

I did this software mainly to understand how the "meteor deploy"
PaaS/sandbox is done. Please don't do bad things :)

This is not my code, I took it from somewhere else repo.
I have modifed it, to use it for my own Digital Ocean.
